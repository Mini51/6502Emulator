# Architecture of the 6502 Microprocessor

The 6502 microprocessor is an 8-bit microprocessor designed in 1975 by members of the MOS Technology team. It was used in many computers and game consoles in the late '70s and early '80s. While the 6502 may no longer be used in modern computers, it remains popular among hobbyists and retro computing enthusiasts. The 6502 is still in use today due to its simplicity and elegance, making it an excellent choice for learning about microprocessors and assembly language programming.

Although we've discussed most components of the 6502 microprocessor in this guide, I wanted to create a section that explains how all of these components work together to make the 6502 function. In this section, we will discuss the registers, memory, ALU, and control unit of the 6502 microprocessor.

## Registers

The 6502 microprocessor has three general-purpose registers and three special-purpose registers. The general-purpose registers are the Accumulator, X register, and Y register. The special-purpose registers are the program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP), and status register (SR).

## Memory

Memory is not technically part of the microprocessor, but to use the microprocessor, you need to have memory. The 6502 microprocessor has a 16-bit bus to address memory, which means it can read and write to up to 64KB of memory.

## Control Unit

The control unit is the part of the microprocessor that handles instructions given to it from memory. It fetches the instruction from memory, decodes it, and executes the bytecode. The control unit is responsible for the overall operation of the microprocessor.

## Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)

The ALU is the part of the microprocessor that performs all the logical and arithmetic operations on data stored in the registers and in memory. The ALU can perform the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Logical AND
- Logical EOR
- Logical OR
- Shift Left
- Shift Right
- Increment
- Decrement
- Compare

## Overview

Below is a block diagram of the 6502 microprocessor showing how the registers, memory, ALU, and control unit are connected:

## Conclusion

In this section, we discussed how the CPU is designed and structured, covering the registers, memory, ALU, and control unit of the 6502 microprocessor. Understanding the role of each component allows you to expand your knowledge to other types of microprocessors and better understand how they function.
