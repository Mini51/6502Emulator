# Getting started

This guide is meant to introduce you to the 6502 microprocessor which is a good stepping stone for understanding how computers work. This guide will also introduce you to how emulation works if you are more interested in that. To teach these topics we will be using the emulator that I have developed which is written in C++ and is open source. This guide will cover the following topics:
