# Introduction to Microprocessors and Assembly Language Programming

## What is a Microprocessor?

A microprocessor is a form of integrated circuit that functions as a Central Processing Unit (CPU). In other words, it is the brain of a computer and allows it to perform logical and arithmetic operations. Microprocessors are in various devices, from personal computers and smartphones to cars and appliances.

## Why Learn About Microprocessors?

Understanding how microprocessors work is essential for people interested in computer science. It provides a unique insight into how computers process information and run programs at the hardware level. However, in this course, we will not look at the current state-of-the-art microprocessors but rather the 6502 microprocessor used in the Apple II, Commodore 64, and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The 6502 microprocessor is a simple and elegant design that is easy to understand and learn from.

## What is Assembly Language?

Assembly is the lowest-level programming language that is human readable. The code is written using mnemonics that represent machine instructions. Assembly language varies depending on the microprocessor architecture. In this course, we will focus on the 6502 assembly language but the concepts can be applied to other microprocessors.

## Why Learn Assembly Language Programming?

Understanding assembly language programming is a crucial skill for computer scientists and engineers. It provides a programmer with a deeper understanding of what the compiled code instructs the computer to do. It also allows for more efficient programming by giving the programmer greater control over the hardware. Additionally, comprehension of assembly language enables reverse engineering and security analysis.

## Introduction to the 6502 Microprocessor

The 6502 microprocessor is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed in 1975 by Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch. It was used in many computers and game consoles in the late 70's and early 80's. The 6502 microprocessor is known for its simplicity and elegance, making it an excellent choice for learning about microprocessors and assembly language programming.
